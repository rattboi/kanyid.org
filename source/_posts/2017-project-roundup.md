Ok, so my last post was all about what I was gonna do this year. The #1 thing on there was blog more! Jeez, what's with this guy (me)? He sucks. 

Instead of trying to get all deep about something, I'm thinking it's a good idea to just get something out about a few of the projects I worked on in the last 7 months. 

## All the Things

1. [Atari 7800 UAV Installation](#a7800)
1. [Zenith TV Interface](#zenith-tv)
1. [Musicbot for Hangouts](#musicbot)
1. [Trello-concert-tracker](#trello-track)
1. [ice-rom](#ice-rom)
1. [Open Source Scan Converter](#ossc)
1. [Steambot](#steambot)
1. [Google Play Music Desktop Player feature](#gpmdp)
1. [Standup bot feature and web frontend](#standup)

### <a name="a7800"></a>Atari 7800 UAV Installation

This is the most recent completed project. "Complete" is a fairly subjective word though, so the likelihood that I pop the top on my Atari 7800 again soon is fairly high. The point of this project was to install the Atari UAV board inside my 7800 in order to get a much better video signal out of it. 

The Atari 7800 only had one type of video out supported, ye olde radio frequency. I.e. this is basically a form of the old box deal you'd screw into the coax from your NES, except it was integrated into the console itself. This is, in fact, the worst consumer standard for video (and audio) output. It combines all the signals into a single crappy signal that is then adjusted to appear on channel 3 of your old-ass televiewer. Needless to say, this didn't look great on my LCD tv. It really never looked good on any TV, but our standards have changed since the 80s. 

This guy on the AtariAge forum sells a kit he's designed to tap into the mainboard of various Atari console and computers, and skip the RF interface altogether, giving you a nice S-Video and/or composite video signal. Pretty boss. The forum post has lots of images to gawk at. I was after the s-video signal, myself. 

There really wasn't that much to the installation of the board itself. I decided to pull the RF adapter altogether, and place the board in its location. The main thing I had any issues with were all mechanical. For whatever reason, mechanical stuff is just not my forte. When I was ready to install the sucker, I realized it didn't come with any of the mechanical parts, like the s-video plug or the rca jacks, so I had to order those from mouser. Once I received them, I went to work figuring out where I wanted the plugs located. After that, I just started drilling on the case, because I'm a dumbass. One mistake I made was not giving adequate spacing between the RCA jacks, so the audio left + right jacks are too close together and it's a real squeeze to get both plugs in. Also, the jacks are low enough on the slope of the case that it's an issue to have them plugged in and not propping up the entire case like a bike kickstand. Also, I tried to eyeball the placement for the center of the s-video jack drill-out, and I was way off. I ended up needing to use a dremel to fix it, and it came out alright.

The last little thing was that the audio lines don't go through the board, and instead are just tapped from the mainboard and are expected to go to a 10uF capacitor before the jacks. I didn't order that, but luckily I had some on-hand from my now-ancient toolbox from my ECE undergrad degree.

Overall, I'd give myself like a 3/5 for planning, but everything worked out ok in the end, and I have the sharpest 7800 pixels you've ever seen. You could cut yourself on them. They're gonna look even more awesome once I receive my Panasonic BT-M1390Y. Here's some screenshots from my LCD, for now. I didn't grab any "before" shots (see? more poor planning), so here's a couple I found online.
