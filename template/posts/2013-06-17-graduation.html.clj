(p "Now that I've graduated from " (link "Portland State University" "http://www.pdx.edu/") " with a Bachelor's degree in " (link "Computer Engineering" "http://www.pdx.edu/ece/") ", I will be using my new free time to work on fun projects, including this site!")

  (p "Another coping mechanism, as I transition away from full-time schooling, will be to take a few online classes on " (link "Coursera" "https://www.coursera.org/") ", and independently continue my education, at least until I start a Master's Degree program. I'm currently registered for one class, and will be writing about my experience here on my site.")

  (p "The course is called " (link  "Startup Engineering" "https://www.coursera.org/course/startup") ", and covers a lot about building technology startups, which I find interesting. I'm also planning on using it to learn some more about web development, which is a set of skills I feel I am sorely lacking.")
